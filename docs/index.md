# Reproducing a Deep Learning Paper
### By Asror Wali & Erwin Russel

This is a short blog about a reproduction of the paper "W-Net: A Deep Model for Fully Unsupervised Image Segmentation".
This reproduction is part of the CS4240 Deep Learning course at the TU Delft.

We were asked to choose from a list of papers, where this was the one we found most interesting.
There was a Github repository attached to the paper which we could use, in this blog we will describe the process of using this code repository and adapting it to achieve the results that were displayed in the paper.
Next to reproducing the cool segmentation abilities of the WNet architecture, we also want to see how our reproduction benchmarked against the model in the paper. There is a table explaining various benchmarks that we will go into in this blog. 

## The Model

## Losses

## Post-processing

## Results

## Conclusion
